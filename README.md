# Caddy Small Shield

> 5 gp, 3 lbs, AC +1

This Caddy module has two functions:

- filter away IPs based on a blacklist loaded from a URL and a whitelist
- "close up shop" at given hours

### IP Filtering

It is really simple (for now), it loads a URL containing a blacklist of IPs or IP ranges

```
...
134.122.168.0/24
134.122.188.0/23
137.59.236.0/22
...
```

and filter away requests coming from those IPs.

> In the examples we use [firehol_level1 on github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktsaou/blocklist-ipsets/master/firehol_level1.netset), please do not abuse their bandwidth.

Also, it allows to specify a comma-separated list of IPs to consider as reputable, despite the blacklist.

It works with IPV4.

It tries to do it as fast as possible, using a high-performance and space-efficient bit tree to calculate
the IP "fate".

The parser of the blacklist looks in each line for a pattern that resembles an IP or an IP range, and loads
it. Lines not containing any are ignored, as lines beginning with `#` or `;` are.

### "Closing hours"

It simply accepts a list of "closing hours": `403` will be returned when attempting to connect at those hours.

### Logging

When `log_blockings` is present and set to `true` or `1`, it will log blocked attempts to connect to caddy's
`info` log channel.

## Building

```bash
xcaddy build --with github.com/proofrock/caddy_smallshield@v0.3.3
```

## Configuration

```caddyfile
{
 order caddy_smallshield first
}

:8089 {
 caddy_smallshield {
  whitelist "127.0.0.1"
  # Please do not abuse, e.g. reloading the config too many times
  blacklist_url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktsaou/blocklist-ipsets/master/firehol_level1.netset"
  closing_hours "8, 10"
  log_blockings "1"
 }
 respond "Hello, World!"
}
```

## Testing

In the repo root, run:

```bash
xcaddy run -- --config Caddyfile
```

After creating a `Caddyfile` such as the above sample, you can (attempt to) connect with:

```bash
curl localhost:8089 -v
```
